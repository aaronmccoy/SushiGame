This is a java based game designed to demonstrate model view controller patterns.  The object of the game is to accumulate as much money as possible by creating
different sushi plates, while competing with other chefs.

###How to play:


Select ingredients and amounts using the options on the right hand side.  Choose which color to make the plate, plate color determines the price.  More expensive plates will net you more money, but are less likely to be chosen.  Once you've made all your selections, hit "create roll/nigiri/sashimi" to put your plate on the conveyor belt.  Only one plate can be placed at a time, so before you can make another you'll need to hit "rotate".  You can choose to not place a plate by pressing "rotate" again, as many times as you like.  Each rotation, customers choose plates to eat, making money for that plates chef.  Plates expire if they stay on the conveyor for too many rotations and are removed uneaten.
